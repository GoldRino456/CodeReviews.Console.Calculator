# Calculator

An implementation of the Calculator project from the Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 learning materials (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-console?view=vs-2022), but with some minor improvements to expand upon the application.

## Features

- Make calculations using both integers and/or decimal numbers with the four basic math operators (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).
- Utilize trig functions (Sine, Cosine, Tangent), find the square root of a number, raise a number to the power of a second number, and 10x a number.
- Store and use previous results in future calculations.
- Informs the user how many calculations were made just before the application closes.
